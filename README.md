# State-Geonode-Templates
templates for State GeoNode

The Plan:

This repo will hold the modified template and static files for the State GeoNode. This repo is supposed to exist within the GeoNode project directory This repo will also contain a script that will automatically load the template and static files into the right directories, and a script that will pull in modified files back into the repository before a commit.
